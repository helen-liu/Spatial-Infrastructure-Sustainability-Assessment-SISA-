This is a QGIS Plugin which is implemented based on the sustainability assessment framework designed in Mengmeng Liu's PHD dissertation (2019-05). It can help users evaluate sustainability of any defined object in multiple sustainability dimensions at different spacial scales.It provides components to define sustainability assessment objectives, to select indicators, to calculate the value of some indicators, to conduct multi-criteria decision analysis (pre-analysis, weighting, and aggregation of indicators), to evaluate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the assessment results, and to visualize sustainability evaluation results in multiple ways.
